What it is?
-----------
A Tool to convert strings of Hex Decimal "12FE4A852F" Values to a Hexifyed "0x12, 0xFE, 0x4A, 0x85, 0x2F, " Hex Decimal Value
 and Vice-Verca. Simpli.
 
It also hase Drag&Drop and you can DD a file to hexify into the GUI.

All config file stuff is moved to application defind user settings. The app will autometicly check for correct alligment
regarding Bytes and Hex and correct it if needed.

Changed the Hexifyer and Dehexifyer Routines to something more solid.

Added checks IsHex() and IsHexifyed().
